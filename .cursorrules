Before attempting any code modification, suggestion, or debugging task:

Always analyze the existing code structure to understand the architecture, patterns, and conventions used in the project.
Always read the README file and any other documentation (like contributing guides, style guides, etc.) to understand the project's purpose, requirements, and established guidelines.
Confirm your understanding of the code structure and project requirements with the user before proceeding with any changes.

This preliminary analysis is mandatory for every new project or codebase you encounter.
